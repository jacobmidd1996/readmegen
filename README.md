My motivation for this project was to provide a simple and easy way for budding coders to build README files.
I Built this so other coders will not struggle writing a README like i have in the past.
I believe it will solve the writters block problem many coders get at the end of a project as they write the README file.
Building this i learned how to connect the terminal commands to my VS code application, learning how to make new files and getting responses through the terminal.
My application will stand out because it will become a necessity for new coders,saving them time and mental energy.
