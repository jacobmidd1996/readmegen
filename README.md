## Description

README generator using NODE js

The motivation behind building a README generator app is to simplify the documentation process for developers, enabling them to quickly create clear and professional project overviews, thus enhancing collaboration and project visibility.. The app solves the problem of tedious and time-consuming README creation by automating the generation of structured and standardized documentation for software projects. I believe it will solve the writters block problem many coders get at the end of a project as they write the README file.
Building this i learned how to connect the terminal commands to my VS code application, learning how to make new files and getting responses through the terminal.
My application will stand out because it will become a necessity for new coders,saving them time and mental energy.
